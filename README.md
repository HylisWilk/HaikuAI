This is my submission for NaNoGenMo 2021. It's 3060 Japanese haiku generated by a rule/template-based algorithm.
With the Kanji, Hiragana and translated versions, it has a total of more than 50k words, as per the rules. 
Translations were done with Google Translate and DeepL APIs.

The code needs some massive cleaning and refactoring but I'll work more on that after the deadline.

Two tiny details are that the cover image was also generated with an algorithm (Genetic Algorithm) and this author name was created with a seq2seq model.
