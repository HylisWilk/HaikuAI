# HaikuAI
人工知能句集 - Collection of Artificial Intelligence Haiku

This is my submission for NaNoGenMo 2021. It's 3060 Japanese haiku generated by a rule/template-based algorithm.
With the Kanji, Hiragana and translated versions, it has a total of more than 50k words, as per the rules. 
Translations were done with Google Translate and DeepL APIs.

The full generated book can be found on [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yePbqfQV1e0C1oFghapKyVrB_W6UfG6P/view?usp=sharing).

The code needs some massive cleaning and refactoring but I'll work more on that after the deadline.
